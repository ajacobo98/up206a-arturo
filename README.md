# About Me
My name is Arturo Jacobo and I am a first-year Master of Urban and Regional Planning student at UCLA Luskin concetrating in Transportation Planning and Policy. 

I am taking Intro to GIS and Spatial Data Science to develop my technical skills for a career in planning as well as to explore my interests in transportation/transit-oriented development and housing equity and justice through a spatial data science lens.

# Project Space
My data science project for this course will incorporate themes at the intersection of transportation planning and development and housing with a focus on a specific region. I plan on using the various skills and methods I learn in this course to research the relationship between these issues and visualize the data that I collect.
