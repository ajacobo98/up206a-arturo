# Hello!

My name is Arturo Jacobo and I am a first-year Master of Urban and Regional Planning student at UCLA Luskin concetrating in Transportation Planning and Policy. 

I am taking Intro to GIS and Spatial Data Science to develop my technical skills for a career in planning as well as to explore my interests in transportation/transit-oriented development, housing equity and justice, and urban climate resilience through a spatial data science lens.
