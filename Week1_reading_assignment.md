# Geography Brings Equity and Social Justice into Focus in King County"- Margot Bordne and Clinton Johsnon

The article details the work of Greg Babinski, a leader at the King County GIS Center in Washington state. Babinsky was a student of William Bunge, a geographer who focused on social justice and learned about the use of spatial analysis to identify and address urban inequities. At the King County GIS Center, Babinsky and his team have used GIS to assist with project and policy analysis, specifically focusing on the equity and justice-related outcomes of projects and policies such as health and income outcomes associated with race in King County. Bordne and Johnson, the authors of the article, highlight that Babinski has shown a commitment to using spatial analysis to pursue equity and justice such as the principles that he drafted for equity-focused GIS work. In addition to project and policy analysis, the King County GIS team also used spatial analysis to identify communities that lack sufficient internet service to assist them with receiving proper coverage. Lastly, Babinski informed Bordne and Johnson that the process of using data must be consistent and of high quality because mitigating inequities through different projects and policies will take years.

This piece provided a great example of the spatial analysis equity work currently being done by people in important GIS leadership positions. Babinski offered a key principle for those engaging or seeking to engage in the work of equity using GIS that has now informed the way in which I will approach my own work with spatial analysis in this course. He believes that GIS analysis should identify the "policies and systems rather than outcomes" to truly redress inequality. One of the reasons I am taking this course is to develop my spatial analysis skills so that I can work on projects that prioritize equity and racial justice. My approach when analyzing these issues has been two focus on both the sources and outcomes of inequity, but Babinski's work helps in reshifting my focus towards the sources to actually pursue equity. The article drew my attention for this reason because it detailed how Babinski's spatial analysis work has focused on sources of inequity and resulted in positive and transformative outcomes because he occupies a role that impacts projects and policies. While my overarching data science goals were to pursue equity before reading this article, I have a more informed understanding of the power that my data science skills will have in my career and work in urban planning to address systems of inequity.
