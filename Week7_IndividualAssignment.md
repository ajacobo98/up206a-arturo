# "Parking search caused congestion: Where's all the fuss?" Reaction
I found this article to be particularly insightful in defining "cruising", specifically excess travel, and its relationship to traffic congestion as well as its
discussion surrounding research and policy implications. While I was aware that drivers searching for parking contribute to urban congestion, this article helped
to focus my understanding on excess travel associated with searching for parking, rather than focusing broadly on the search for parking when drivers reach their
destination. By focusing on excess travel, the authors were able to center their research on the negative externalities of parking searches for the purposes
of informing policy. I was particularly interested by their methodology which incorporated the use of GPS data to understand excess travel, unlike previous studies that relied on methods like
surveying. As someone interested in transportation planning and policy, the researchers' methodology is indicative to me of the power and versatility of data 
science in solving transportation issues and informing transportation policy. Lastly, the article illuminated the importance of taking place and time into account
when solving complex issues like congestion caused by cruising. While congestion due to cruising is present across urban areas, the authors identify that factors
like street patterns or parking scarcity impact excess travel. Thus, when creating policy, multiple factors must be accounted for especially the region and space
policy is impacting.
