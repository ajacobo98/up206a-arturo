# Geoff Boeing Presentation to Urban Planners
I found Geoff Boeing's presentation very insightful regarding the power and versatility of urban data science as well as its importance in the future for planners.
As a student who is new to learning data science skills, it was reassuring to hear that they are extremely useful whether one plans to be a consultant or researcher and that I will be able to use the skills I am learning in this class to do meaningful work.
Despite the various uses of urban data science, it is not fully accessible, which Geoff discussed briefly. He noted that because of the tools involved in learning this skill, it remains somewhat inaccessible; however, classes like Intro to GIS are key to increasing access and teaching the fundamentals of data science. 
I often think of issues of access and equity as they relate to planning and through this class, I am learning technical skills that will allow me to further explore my interests. 
Yet, this presentation illuminated the fact that even the tools that can be used to explore and mitigate inequities are inaccessible themselves, upholding inequity to a certain extent.
